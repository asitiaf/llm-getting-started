# LLM Getting Started

A growing collection of practical, beginner-friendly LLM projects using **Python**, **LangChain**, and **LangSmith**.  
Designed to help you learn by building real concepts ‚Äî from basic prompting to multi-agent coordination.

> Inspired by the [LLM Engineering Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mlane/llm-engineering-cheatsheet)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlane/llm-getting-started.git
cd llm-getting-started

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.sample .env
# Fill in your OpenAI / LangSmith API keys

# Run an example project
python3 debate_agent.py
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Scripts are now located at the top level, not inside subfolders. For example, use `debate_agent.py` instead of `projects/debate_agent/main.py`.

## Concept Reference Guide

Each script lists "Concepts" it demonstrates. Here's what they mean:

### LLM Behaviors (Descriptive)

| Behavior                         | Concept                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| No examples given                | zero-shot reasoning                     |
| Examples in prompt               | few-shot prompting                      |
| Explicit persona or tone         | system prompts, persona control         |
| Responds to previous turns       | short-term memory, conversation history |
| Simulates disagreement or debate | agent disagreement                      |
| Builds on previous answers       | turn-based dialogue                     |
| Explains steps                   | chain of thought                        |

### Interaction Patterns

| Structure/Flow                  | Concept                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Live user input loop            | interactive session     |
| Two or more agents taking turns | multi-agent interaction |
| Message-based prompt passing    | conversational flow     |
| Uses tools or actions           | tool execution          |

Use these as a reference when reading or extending scripts.
